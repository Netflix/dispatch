# Incidents

## Dashboard

The dashboard should be pretty self-explanatory. It attempts to provide some meaningful insights across all of incident managed by Dispatch. Do we have an uptick in a particular type of incident? Are we getting better at responding to incidents?

## Incidents

During an incident most actions are managed by the incident channel ops commands \(e.g. `/dispatch-edit-incident` \). However, when an incident closes you may need to modify incident details, the Admin Web UI is the place to manage these regardless of the state of the incident. It provides a more holistic view incidents as well as allowing you to search across incident.

## Tasks

Similar to `Incident` most incident tasks are managed in the incident channel itself. But when you want to view _all_ incident tasks across the organization this admin view gives you that ability.
