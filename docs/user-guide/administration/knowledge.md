# Knowledge

## Applications

Applications like Terms only have meaning in particular contexts, within Dispatch application names are important enough to be separated from other terms, and given additional metadata surrounding them.

## Documents

Documents are links to external sources \(Web Pages, Google Documents, etc.,\). These documents can be associated with Terms allowing these documents to be recommended reading for incident participants. 

The best use case for documents is tracking, managing and recommending, incident run books.

## Terms

Terms are words or phrases that may not have any meaning to an outside observer but have deep organizational meaning, things like acronyms or phrases. 

Terms are also used for explicit association of incidents. For instance take the term "PCI" this has a deep organizational meaning, and thus is a term that should be track. More over, it's important enough the Teams, and Individuals may want to be pulled into any incident that contains this key term. 

Any defined term and be associated to Teams, Services, or Individuals for incident inclusion.

## Definitions

Definitions are used to collect and manage term definitions from various sources, this enabled incident participants to quickly understand the language and terms being used through an incident.

A definition can be associated with one or more terms \(in case of term overload\).
