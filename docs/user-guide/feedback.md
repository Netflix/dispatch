## Incident Feedback

Dispatch sends a direct message on incident close to all incident participants asking them to rate their satisfaction on how to incident was handled and to provide feedback. Feedback submitted by incident participants is stored and displayed in the feedback section of the UI, and shared with the incident's commander via email on a daily basis.
