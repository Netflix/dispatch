# Cost Model

Our Incident Cost Model is a feature that enables teams to estimate incident response cost for each incident. This new update enables users to opt into and create personalized cost calculations for each incident based on participant activity.

If no cost model is assigned to an incident, the default classic cost model will be used. See [Incident Cost Type](../../administration/settings/incident/incident-cost-type.mdx###calculating-incident-cost).

## Key Features

### Customizable Cost Models
Users have the flexibility to define their unique cost models based on their organization's workflow and tools. This customization can be tailored to each incident, providing a versitile approach to cost calculation. The cost model for an incident can be changed at any time during its lifespan. All participant activity costs moving forward will be calculated using the new cost model.

### Plugin-Based Tracking
Users can track costs from their existing tools by using our plugin-based tracking system. Users have the flexibility to select which plugins and specific plugin events they want to track, offering a targeted approach to cost calculation.

### Effort Assignment
For each tracked activity, users can assign a quantifiable measure of effort, represented in seconds of work time. This feature provides a more accurate representation of the cost of an incident.

### Incident Cost Calculation
Incident cost calculation is based on the cost model and effort assignment for each tracked participant activity. This helps in understanding resource utilization and cost of an incident.
