# Data Formats

Data sources are not always uniformed in nature. It's often helpful to understand what the underlying data format for a given data source is. Here, Dispatch allows you to define common data formats that sources in your environment use.

Some example data formats:

- JSON
- CSV
- Syslog
- XML
- Non-standard
