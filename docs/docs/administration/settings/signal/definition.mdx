# Signal Definition

Signal Defintions are your starting point for onboarding a new Signal into Dispatch and allow a number of different configuration options.

## Sending Signals to Dispatch

You can send a signal to Dispatch by making a `POST` request to the `/{organization}/signals/instances` API endpoint.

```python
import requests

API_TOKEN = ""
API_ENDPOINT = "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/default/signals/instances"

signal_instance = {
  "project": "Test",
  "raw": {
    "name": "process_events",
    "externalId": "someExternalValue",
    "id": "<uuid>", # this will be used as the instance's uuid if provided
    "variant": "A" , # an additional indicator for signal subtypes
    "hostIdentifier": "host1",
    "calendarTime": "2022-10-19T10:35:01Z",
    "time": 1618698901,
    "columns": {
      "pid": 888,
      "path": "/usr/bin/security",
      "cmdline": "/usr/bin/security dump-keychain",
      "state": "running",
      "parent": 555,
      "created_at": 1918698901,
      "updated_at": 2118698901
    }
  }
}

requests.Session()
r = session.post(
    API_ENDPOINT,
    json=signal_instance,
    headers={
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_TOKEN}",
    },
)
```

## Creating a Signal Definition

At a high level, you'll need to configure some basic metadata about your `signal` such as the name, description, and variant.
You can also configure whether a `signal` should create a case or not. Choosing not to create a case can be useful for contextual signals that
don't necessarily warrant triage and investigation on their own. But, you can still use these signals to enrich other signals and cases.

**Variant**: The same signal can have multiple varitants with different defintions.

**Owner**: Typically the team or owner that produces the Siganl.

**External ID**: This ID will be used to correctly associate incoming signals to this definition. This ID should be unique across all Signal Definitions.

**Conversation Target**: Defines the channel name where the Case for the Signal will be created.
