# Filter

Signal Filters are used to define how Signals should be grouped together or when they should be snoozed.

## Snooze Filter

Snooze filters make use of entities extracted from signals to define when a signal should be snoozed.
For example, you can create a Snooze Filter that will snooze all incoming Signals that contain a specific JA3 hash.
You also have the option to create a `Snooze Filter` without specifying any entities, which will snooze all incoming signals matching that filter.
This feature is useful when an influx of signals is expected for a given period of time (e.g. some known administration activities) and you want to temporarily stop cases from being created. Even when a signal is snoozed it will still be processed and associated entities will be created.

## Deduplication Filter

In order to perform signal duplication, a duplication filter must be created. Deduplication filters leverage extracted signal entity types and a sliding time window in order to determine if a signal should be marked as a duplicate. If a match is found, the current signal is marked as duplicate and it is associated with the existing case.

:::info
By default, all Signals are deduplicated over a one hour window unless a custom Deduplication Filter is defined.

### Creating a Deduplication Filter

To create a Deduplication Filter, you must first define the Entity Types that will be used to deduplicate Signals.
