# Entity Type

Entity Types enable the extraction of entities from the raw Signal Instance data. These extracted entities are stored and can be used for automatic correlations, engagement filters, and signal filters.

### Creating an Entity Type

To create an Entity Type, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to a Signal Definition edit page.
2. Click on the '+' icon adjacent to the 'Entity Type(s)' dropdown menu.

The Entity Type playground will open in a modal window. The playground is a tool that allows you to create and test your Entity Type. Entity Types can be defined as regular expressions or in JSON Path format.
