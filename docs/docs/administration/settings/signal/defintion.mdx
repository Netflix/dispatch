# Signal Definition

Signal Defintions are your starting point for onboarding a new Signal into Dispatch and allow a number of different configuration options.

## Creating a Signal Definition

At a high level, you'll need to configure some basic metadata about your Signal such as the name, description, and variant.
You can also configure whether a Signal should create a case or not. Choosing not to create a Case can be useful for contextual Signals that
don't necessarily warrant triage and investigation on their own. But, you can still use these Signals to enrich other Signals and Cases.
