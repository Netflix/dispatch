# Projects

Every case or incident within Dispatch is tied to a project. The project configuration determines how cases or incidents are created and managed. This allows multiple teams to use Dispatch in different ways.

From having their own case or incident types and priorities to providing the team with a view of their metrics.

### When should I create a new project vs using an existing one?

Generally, you would create a new project when the teams involved have very little overlap when handling cases or incidents.

For example, you might create a `security` project for the handling of all security-related cases or incidents and a `reliability` project for all outage-related incidents.
