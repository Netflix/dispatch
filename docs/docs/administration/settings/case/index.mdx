# Case

Cases are meant to triage events that do not raise to the level of incidents, but can be escalated to incidents if necessary. If you map a case type to an incident type and you escalate the case, then Dispatch will automatically create an incident and link the two.

While Dispatch holds some strong opinions about _how_ to run cases. It does allow for quite a lot of flexibility. Below you will find several different areas that allow you to make the case experience fit your organization.
