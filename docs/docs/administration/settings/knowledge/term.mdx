# Terms

Terms are words or phrases that may not have any meaning to an outside observer but have deep organizational meaning (e.g., acronyms and names).

As an example, take the term PCI. In the security world, this acronym typically refers to the Payment Card Industry security standard.

Any defined term can be associated with Teams, Services, or Individuals for incident inclusion.
