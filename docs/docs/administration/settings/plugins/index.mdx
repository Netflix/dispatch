# Plugins

Before being able to configure and use the plugins, refer to the [CLI](../../cli.mdx#plugins) documentation about installing plugins.

Much of Dispatch's functionality comes from its plugins. The current Dispatch web UI is limited to enabling and disabling plugins on a per-project basis. To make modifications to how plugins behave or are configured, changes must be deployed via the server configuration file. See the [server](../server.mdx) configuration documentation for more information.

By default, no plugins are _required_ to create an incident. As you enable plugins, they will be additive to the incident process (e.g., creating slack channels, google docs, etc.)

Looking to add your own functionality to Dispatch via plugins? See the [contributing](../../contributing/plugins/index.mdx) documentation.
