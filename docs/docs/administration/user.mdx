# User Management

Users or organizational members represent users of the Dispatch UI and are different from individual contacts or incident participants. These user accounts are used to control access to the Dispatch UI only. We do not currently support the creation or removal of users via the Dispatch UI, except in the case of self-registration.

**Role:** Dispatch uses role-based access control (RBAC) for its UI. Currently, this is only used to protect sensitive incidents whose visibilty is set to restricted. We do not currently have any controls surrounding Dispatch configuration and settings. There are four roles defined by Dispatch:

- Member: Can access everything except restricted incidents unless they are a direct participant.
- Admin: Allows full access to the Dispatch UI and all incidents, whether their visibility is open or restricted.
- Manager: Currently the same as Admin.
- Owner: Allows full access to the Dispatch UI and to manager organizations.

**Settings:**

- Default Projects: List of projects that Dispatch will use to apply filtering across the UI (e.g. case or incident tables and dashboards).
