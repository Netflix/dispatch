# Administration

The Dispatch Web UI is home to all of Dispatch administration abilities; these contain things that are likely to change frequently \(less often changed items live in the Dispatch configuration file\).

To access Dispatch settings, look for the `Settings` menu item and select a project which you want to administer.
