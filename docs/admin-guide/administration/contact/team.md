## Team

Like `Individuals`, there are often groups of individuals (teams) that need to be engaged and notified during an incident. Dispatch manages those groups \(typically, team distribution lists\), providing a centralized data store for that contact data.

**Name:** Name of the team.

**Email:** Email address associated with the team.

**Company:** Company associated with the team.

#### Engagement

In addition to fields about the team, Dispatch allows you to associate a team with other Dispatch primitives. For instance, if you would like to involve an entire team for all incidents of a given priority, associate that priority with the team.
