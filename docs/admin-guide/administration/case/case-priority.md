**Description:** The incident priority description presented to the user when reporting.

**View Order:** The ranked order which the priority will be listed in menus and dropdowns.

**Tactical Report Reminder:** Number of hours between reminders.

**Executive Report Reminder:** Number of hours between reminders.

**Default Incident Priority:** If the reporter of an incident does not provide an incident priority, a default will be used. Enable the setting to make this incident priority the default.

**Page Commander:** Ensures that the incident commander is paged for all incidents with this priority (if configured paging service and plugin allows).
