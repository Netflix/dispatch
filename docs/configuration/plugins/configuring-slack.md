# Configuring Slack

By default, Dispatch ships with support for Slack. Below, is how to configure the slack plugin to work with `Dispatch`.

{% hint style="info" %}
The `Slack` plugin relies on the [Events API](https://api.slack.com/events-api) to receive events for the event types the app is subscribed to. `Dispatch` receives these events at the `/api/v1/events/slack/event` API endpoint. Slack will also send Web requests to the `/api/v1/events/slack/command` and `/api/v1/events/slack/action` API endpoints for slash \(`/`\) commands and interactive components like dialogs. These endpoints must be publicly available in order for the `Dispatch` Slack app to work correctly.
{% endhint %}

## Configuration

#### `SLACK_APP_USER_SLUG`

> Specifies the Slack app id, so Dispatch can filter events generated by the app \(e.g. message posted in the channel\). Slack specifically calls this an "App ID."

#### `SLACK_WORKSPACE_NAME`

> Specifies the name of the workspace the Slack app is installed in. This is typically the subdomain provided by Slack. For example, if your Slack workspace is accessible at "example.slack.com," you would set your workspace name to "example".

#### `SLACK_API_BOT_TOKEN` \[secret: True\]

> The app's bot token necessary to communicate with the Slack API. Slack refers to this as your "Bot User OAuth Access Token," and should be revealed to app collaborators when you install the app.

#### `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` \[secret: True\]

> Secret used to verify signatures included on each HTTP request that Slack sends. Slack refers to this as your "Signing Secret."

#### `SLACK_USER_ID_OVERRIDE` \[default: None\]

> Used during development to funnel all messages to a particular user.

#### `SLACK_BAN_THREADS` \[default: True\]

> Do not allow threaded messages in incident channels.

#### `SLACK_PROFILE_DEPARTMENT_FIELD_ID`

> Specifies the profile field ID where Department is mapped

#### `SLACK_PROFILE_TEAM_FIELD_ID`

> Specifies the profile field ID where Team is mapped

#### `SLACK_PROFILE_WEBLINK_FIELD_ID`

> Specifies the profile field ID where the weblink is mapped

### Commands

#### `SLACK_COMMAND_TACTICAL_REPORT_SLUG` \[default: '/dispatch-tactical-report'\]

#### `SLACK_COMMAND_EXECUTIVE_REPORT_SLUG` \[default: '/dispatch-executive-report'\]

#### `SLACK_COMMAND_LIST_MY_TASKS_SLUG` \[default: '/dispatch-list-my-tasks'\]

> Sends an ephemeral message with the list of your open and resolved incident tasks.

#### `SLACK_COMMAND_LIST_PARTICIPANTS_SLUG` \[default: '/dispatch-list-participants'\]

> Sends an ephemeral message with the list of incident participants.

#### `SLACK_COMMAND_UPDATE_PARTICIPANT_SLUG` \[default: '/dispatch-update-participant'\]

## Event Subscriptions

To enable Dispatch to process Slack events, ensure your bot is subscribed to the following events:

## Commands

To enable Dispatch's slash commands you must add them to the Slack app first. Ensure that the `Command` matches the configuration variables above \(e.g. `/dispatch-update-incident`\) and that the `Request URL` points to the events command API endpoint of the Dispatch server at `/api/v1/events/slack/command`.

## Interactivity

To enable Dispatch to generate interactive components such as dialogs, ensure that the `Request URL` is pointing to the event action API endpoing of the Dispatch server at `/api/v1/events/slack/action`.

## Reactions

Dispatch creates events off of Slack messages reacted with the `stopwatch` reaction, which then are displayed in the incident timeline. The event will contain the contents and author of the message.

## OAuth & Permissions

The Bot User OAuth Access Token is used to issue queries against the Slack API.
