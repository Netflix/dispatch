# Configuring Slack

{% hint style="info" %}
Dispatch ships with support for Slack. Below, is how to configure the Slack plugin to work with `Dispatch`. This plugin is required for core functionality.

The plugin relies on the [Events API](https://api.slack.com/events-api) to receive events for the event types the app is subscribed to. `Dispatch` receives these events at the `/api/v1/events/slack/event` API endpoint. Slack will also send Web requests to the `/api/v1/events/slack/command` and `/api/v1/events/slack/action` API endpoints for slash \(`/`\) commands and interactive components like dialogs and modals. These endpoints must be publicly available in order for the `Dispatch` Slack app to work correctly.
{% endhint %}

## Slack Configuration

### Event Subscriptions

To enable Dispatch to process Slack events, ensure your bot is subscribed to the following events:

### Interactivity

To enable Dispatch to generate interactive components such as dialogs and modals, ensure that the `Request URL` is pointing to the events action API endpoint of the Dispatch server at `/api/v1/events/slack/action`.

### Slash Commands

To enable Dispatch's slash commands you must add them to the Slack app first. Ensure that the `Command` field matches the configuration variables in the XXX section \(e.g. `/dispatch-update-incident`\) and that the `Request URL` points to the events command API endpoint of the Dispatch server at `/api/v1/events/slack/command`.
